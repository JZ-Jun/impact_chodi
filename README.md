## Getting Started
To utilize Flutter on any IDE in Windows
- Download and install Flutter
- Right-click “This PC” (not the shortcut)
- Click on Properties
- Scroll down and click on “Advanced system settings.”
- Click on “Environment variables.”
- Double-click on “Path.”
- Click “New”
- Find the location of the flutter sdk folder
- Copy the folder address, e.q. “C:/User/FlutterSDK/flutter/bin”
- Paste the bin folder path
- Click OK
- Restart IDE and PC

Download VScode
- Visit https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Select the correct installer for your computer usage
- Start the installer
- Click on “I accept the agreement”
- Select the location preferred to download the VScode launcher and files then click “Next”
- Click on “Next”
- Click “Finish” once loading is completed

We chose to use VScode alongside Android Studio because the VScode IDE has a lot more adaptability and conventional error-solving mechanics to resolve coding errors more efficiently.
